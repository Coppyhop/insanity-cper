# Insanity-cper

A remake of Insanity Sweeper in C++

##About

I started this project to help myself learn more about C++ and how it can be
better for game development and just development in general. Moving this project
away from java I hope to learn about C++, memory management, and
cross-compilation with multiple platforms (Windows-x86-64, ARMv8, and PowerPC,
yes PowerPC). 

##The Game

It's Minesweeper... but on obnoxiously large boards. Is this thing fun? Probably
not. Does this thing have a purpose? Definitely not. Why am I making it? To 
learn C++. Maybe I can come up with some better mechanics/gameplay for the game
to make it more entertaining in the future. Right now I'm just aiming for 
feature parity of the original make in java.

##Building

Want to build this project yourself? First clone the repository, go grab the
latest source for GLFW, put that in the root of the clone and configure CMake 
accordingly. (For those of you more savvy in C++ you can probably make the 
CMakeLists a bit better... this is my first project and I'm kinda confused lol).

##Contributing

This project is mainly for my learning purposes, any contributions prior to me 
"finishing" it may be ignored (Unless it's correction some malpractice I 
accidentally may have created). If you wish to contribute please give a detailed
explanation of why you're making the changes you are so that I may better learn.
